					LifeThought staff built a professional online presence for a new NGO
					in Bamako, Mali, including a LinkedIn profile and social media
					accounts (Facebook, Instagram) to raise awareness of the NGOs local
					projects and community impact. This will allow the Siraba School to
					showcase its community building project and continue their important
					work. Next steps: creating a service learning framework for the
					school!

					In a world that emphasizes the importance of the individual and
					teaches young people to prioritize their own wishes over connection
					with others, the need to help young people understand their
					responsibility to be good citizens and work for positive change in
					their communities continues to grow. LifeThought International staff
					and volunteers created a series of learning activities to help young
					students (K-6) understand the importance of community belonging,
					showing kindness, expressing gratitude, and serving others. These
					activities also develop students’ English proficiency and
					interpersonal communication skills. The learning materials were
					piloted in #MakeADifference learning activities were piloted by
					English teachers in elementary schools in Chiriqui, Panama, counselors
					at a youth camp in Predeal, Romania, and English classes in Bamako,
					Mali. At the request of international teachers using the curriculum,
					LifeThought volunteers translated the materials into Spanish and
					French. Check out the #MakeADifference learning activities (link page

					Peacemaker Project to create learning activities to help teens learn
					civil communication strategies, practice culturally sensitive
					dialogue, and engage in peacebuilding discussions. Watch for the
					launch of these new learning materials soon!
